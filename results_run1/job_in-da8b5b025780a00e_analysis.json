An understanding of how data can be used beyond reporting; to automate processes across the organisation, to develop new features for Up\u2019s customers, to glean insight into the future. #LI -Hybrid ### Working at Ferocia We have a hybrid work culture where people can attend the Ferocia office as much or as little as makes sense for them, but we are currently only hiring in Melbourne (or adjacent areas) as we still value physically getting together at least a half -dozen times per year.",
